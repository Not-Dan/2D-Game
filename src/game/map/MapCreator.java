//Perhaps we should create a new debug package and store this class there


//This is our tilemap editor contained in a class. It should contain a accessible scene
//that can be run in debug to edit our maps. We should be able to load multiple tilemaps,
//but to start focus on loading one tilemap for all of our maps.
